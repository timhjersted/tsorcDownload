WANT TO MAKE THE GAME EASIER?
----------------------------------------------
Play with up to three friends. 
Turn off "dark souls drop on death" in the mod config options. 
Use the dodge roll often.
Use the Great Magic Mirror for tough spots. It allows you to set a warp point before jumping sections or tough areas. The GMM can be found in the Mountain Caverns to the left of the main village.
Take your time. Explore more. Look for secrets (glowing crystals often hint at clues). 
Asks questions in ‚Å†mod-questions or ‚Å†map-questions. 
Leave and return later to bosses that seem too hard at the moment. 
Read the walkthrough found here: https://github.com/timhjersted/tsorcDownload/blob/6c95c7a9d0742d92dbd363b667eaf9ce184ca789/walkthrough-guide.md
Like with Dark Souls, gaining knowledge of the world, game mechanics, favorable weapon upgrades and effective boss strategies is half the battle. 


WANT TO MAKE THE GAME HARDER? 
----------------------------------------------
Activate the Bearer of the Curse mode using the Dark Sign item you start with at spawn. 
The item describes how it changes the game and can be turned at any time.

For the ultimate challenge, mainly increasing damage received and enemy health, you can also turn on Master Mode, but this mode is still WIP and is NOT recommended for the best experience. 
Bearer of the Curse is our premiere mode and recommended for those seeking the "Dark Souls" experience.


FAQ
----------------------------------------------
"Where do I go from here?" 
90% of the time the best answer is to check your minimap! Look for black areas you have not explored, and fill out all of it that you can. Almost no part of the entire map is unused, you'll find the way soon enough!

"Where is the recipe for [some vanilla item], I can't craft it"
Some vanilla recipes have been removed! You must find these items in the world by exploring instead.

"I'm dying a ton, what gear should I make?" 
Look for items with the "Dark Soul crafting material" tooltip. You can use them to craft items much stronger than vanilla ones! You can also buy starting gear from NPCs

"Where do I get the Tinkerer?" 
You will find him in the world eventually.

"How do I remove bad enchants from my weapons?"
Talk to Jade, she can replace them with the "Blessed" reforge!

"How do I make an obsidian skull" 
You don't, you will find it later. You will need to brave certain areas with fire blocks without its protection!

"Where do I get the shadow key"
You can not find it until you reach mythril-tier.

"What does 'the souls of [X] have been released' mean?" 
Most bosses only drop their souls the first time they die, to prevent farming.

"Where is the fourth lever in hell?" 
You may need to go further out of your way than you would expect to find it it. Search your minimap for unexplored sections!

"Why can't I equip wings?"
Wings can not be used until The Hunter is dead.

"A boss bag ended up somewhere I can't reach, how do I get it?" 
You can pause and disable the "adventure mode" mod setting to let you mine! Just remember to turn it back on after, some parts of the mod depend on it.

"Help, I got stuck somewhere!" 
Same as above! You can also dodgeroll or grapple out of certain gaps too

"I don't have the custom map / it's greyed out" 
The auto-download failed, you can get the world file manually here:  https://github.com/timhjersted/tsorcDownload/tree/1.4 

"I'm in Hard Mode. What do I do after _?" 
Read the clue on all shards that bosses drop in HM. Also keep an eye out for clues on signs/message bubbles. 

"How do permanent potions work? 
The more you use the consumable version of certain potion, the stronger its permanent variant is. Most perma potions go up to 150%. Just remember to toggle the potion (look if said potion has a dark outline, that means it's working, even though you won't see the buff icon). They even work in the Potion Bag.

"Where can I find hallowed armor as well as the Excalibur and other hallowed tier gear? "
A major story event in the room above The Hunter's arena reveals their location 

"How do I fight the Pillars?"
You need to defeat Attraidies then search the skies for their monoliths.

"Where can I fight Moon Lord?"
In this mod Moon Lord is completly optional and not triggered by defeating the Pillars. Its summoning item is intentionally well hidden behind three stone gates in the underworld. Look at the nearby block types for clues.

"I've finished the mod, but I didn't defeat every boss. Can I fix this?" 
Yes you can. All you have to do is defeat Attriades once again to re-trigger SHM. 


GENERAL TIPS AND KNOWLEDGE
----------------------------------------------
Use your dodge roll often (Left Alt by default. Left Shift recommended with Left Alt being Smart Curser). You have invincibility frames while dodging. 

If you're having trouble in the Earth Temple, consider exploring the flooded mines to the right of your grave or the mountain caverns to the left of the main village. There are many secrets to be found and accessible right from the beginning of the game.

Items with the Dark Souls recipe tag can be upgraded with Dark Souls at a Demon Altar.

Read all mod item tool tips. Sometimes story beats and other key info or progression clues can be read there.

Play with the Recipe Browser mod to easily see if loot dropped from enemies or found in chests can be crafted into something else. 

Crafting mod weapons and armor will greatly aid your journey 

Use health regen/defense potions during normal exploration and when retrieving lost souls. Hoarded potions are of no use to the dead! üòâ

Dark Souls are used for 99% of all special mod items, weapons and armors you can craft, and usually in combination with other found materials. 99% of regular Terraria content will be looted from chests.
If a wall is 1 tile wide, you can break it!** You will not be able to mine through anything wider, but... there are a few exceptions you will have to figure out on your own. üòâ

If you can do it, it's okay to do it! The mod prevents you from doing anything that might break the game's design.

Recommended Hot Keys: Pause/Inventory (Q), Quick Heal (F), Quick Buff (B), Quick Mana (C), Grapple (E), Dodge roll (Left Shift)

You may be able to fight a boss before you are able to beat it. If in doubt, continue exploring, level up your gear, and come back when you're stronger. 

Grey Stone Gates cannot be broken and must be opened by a lever or switch 

There are tons of secrets hiding in the map, but they're not all meant to be found on a 1st playthrough. Players that blitz through the map will surely miss many of them, but players that really take in their surroundings and illuminate the corners that are hidden in darkness will be greatly rewarded. If you've played Dark Souls before, it's a great head space to get into for this game. üòâ 

If you see crystals, keep an eye out for secrets, chests or hidden paths nearby. Sometimes crystals are pointing directly in the direction of the secret.

Chest styles reveal their loot quality: fancy chests will have important loot; simple brown or moss-covered brown chests will usually have potions & ammo etc.

Talk to mod NPCs and exhaust their dialog/check their shops every so often 

If you destroy a bonfire on accident or want to place one in sandbox mode (not the adventure map), you can place one by disabling adventure mode, then put down a vanilla campfire then press home and numpad0 on the same frame

Bearer of the Curse Users: Use Quick Heal to use Estus and Quick Mana to use Cerulean Tear 


WORLD UPDATE FYI
----------------------------------------------
If you ever decide you want to update your world to a new version, you can only take the loot that's stored on your character and in your piggy bank and safe. Gates will also need re-opening and your map data will be reset so make the switch after completing a major section of the map. Most map updates are minor so check the ‚Å†map-changelog to decide. Most of the time, you'll only want to restart for a fresh playthrough.
