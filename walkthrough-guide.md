EARLY GAME WALKTHROUGH 
(TSORC PART 1/3)
---------------------------------------------------
This walkthrough contains spoilers as far as telling you where to go and what to do for the first several hours of the game.

Read on if you prefer a guided experience, but know there is no wrong way to play. While the game has an intended path, it also has numerous optional routes and a fairly open-world structure. 


GAME START TO VILLAGE
---------------------------------------------------
Exit your grave. Go West (left) and collect the gear you can find including some armor and shine potions in the burned-down village. Optionally, go back East (right) and enter the flooded cave to find some things.

You will also notice the hill to your right is too steep to climb so you will need to head left to gain new mobility accessories.

Travel West (left) until you get to the Earth Temple's cave entrance. It is blocked by a gemstone gate. 

Go up (North) using the ropes and climb the hill to reach Jade and your first bonfire to light. Beyond that, you will reach Ashenpeak village.


VILLAGE, MOUNTAIN TUNNELS AND EARTH TEMPLE 
---------------------------------------------------
In the village, read all the message bubbles in the order you find them, grab some loot, and then:

A: If you're anxious for a challenge, you can drop down the village well. Explore to the left and right to get some useful items, then enter the Earth temple via the bottom of the well using your pickaxe. This is a secret entrance that bypasses the main entrance.

B: For an easier experience, do not jump down the well yet. From the village, head left and explore the mountain tunnels. You will find crystal hearts and more loot to prepare for the Earth Temple. Your goal is to find a room with a jumping puzzle that has some good rewards, including a green glowing skull you can right click on to obtain a Great Magic Mirror. Your other goal is to find the Wizard's house near the top of the mountain which has the gem key that unlocks the Earth Temple as well as your first gold key. 


EARTH TEMPLE
---------------------------------------------------
A: If you enter the dungeon from the well, head north up the main shaft to find a bonfire and your first demon altar to craft a Light Cube and a Soul Reaper when you can.

B. If you enter the Earth Temple by obtaining the gem and opening the main entrance, travel down until you find a bonfire save point and then use the main shaft to guide your exploration off its various branches. 

Explore the first dungeon as thoroughly as you wish. There are several crystal hearts to find. 

To find the boss, head south down the main shaft to the bottom of the flooded room and head left, then up and left. Rest at the bonfire, solve the pressure-plate puzzle and continue left.

You'll find a summon ring for the Eye. Just up and to the right you will find a bonfire to rest at before hand. 

After defeating it, you'll gain the Hermes Boots and Hero's armor set.

From EoC, head up and to the right of the boss arena to find a shortcut out of the dungeon. Going this way will unlock the bottom half of the village.


CORRUPTION TEMPLE
---------------------------------------------------
After obtaining the Hermes Boots, you'll be able to run and jump across the Great Chasm to the West of Ashenpeak village and enter the Corruption Temple. To find the entrance, you will need to open a secret passageway in the village basement or explore the mountain tunnels and find a way to drop down into the Corrupted Tunnel.

Once inside the temple, continue exploring until you find the Cloud in a Bottle. From here, you can continue exploring, defeat the area boss and grow more powerful. There is an optional 2nd half of the Corruption Temple but unlocking the entrance is a secret.

You are now ready to head East at any time, past the grave where you first spawned.


THE JUNGLE (EAST)
---------------------------------------------------
From here, explore the jungle and be on the lookout for an entrance to the Underground Jungle Ruins. Inside these ruins, will need to find a lever that unlocks a stone gate to progress. Use the lava runes above the gate and jungle vines as clues to find the lever, as well as the clue written in a nearby message bubble. 

Next you will enter a large room with 3 tall golden towers. Climb the tower to find an important item used for exploration. Eventually you will find yourself blocked by another stone gate just past an underground lake. Dive into the lake to find the lever. 

When you find the lever, return to the gate and prepare to fight Skeletron, the First of the Dead. 


THE FORGOTTEN CITY
---------------------------------------------------
From here, you will explore the Forgotten City to search for your missing brother and wife. There is an optional boss here, but after exploring and finding more loot, your goal is to find a safe entrance into the Underworld and the Fire Temple. 


FIRE TEMPLE
---------------------------------------------------
In the Underworld, the ruin floors of the Fire Temple will harm you when walked on. You will need to find an entrance that has cool mud to step on to find your way through the temple safely (in general, head left). There are multiple levers you will need to pull to unlock various gates. One of these gates is notorious for being hidden in the Forgotten City! But there are several visual clues that should lead you to this final lever. 

After opening the final gate, you'll reach a colossal structure. If you've been reading the story message bubbles you've found up to this point, you'll know what must be done here...


This is where this guide ends. We wish you good luck on your adventure!
