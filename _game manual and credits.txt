  :|:::       THE STORY OF RED CLOUD      :::|:



GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*New dodge roll action with i-frames can be bound to any key via the mod config (default: left alt)

*Want to play multiplayer? The map supports up to 4 players. Class diversity recommended.

TIPS & HINTS
-------------------------------------------------
*If loot you discover is a "material," it can likely be crafted into something else with Dark Souls

*Play with the Recipe Browser mod to easily see if loot dropped from enemies or found in chests can be crafted into something else

*Use health regen/defense potions during normal combat and when retrieving lost souls. Hoarded potions are of no use to the dead! ;)

*Dark Souls are used for 99% of all special mod items, weapons and armors you can craft, and usually in combination with other found materials. 99% of regular Terraria content will be looted from chests.

*Play with Auto-Pause turned ON (this will make reading signs and crafting stress free)

*Recommended Hot Keys: Pause/Inventory (Q), Quick Heal (F), Quick Buff (B), Quick Mana (C), Grapple (E), Dodge roll (Right Mouse Click), Action Key (Left Shift)

*You may be able to fight a boss before you are able to beat it. If in doubt, continue exploring, level up your gear, and come back when you're stronger.

*You can stash excess loot in the safe and piggy bank found at most save points. 

*You will die. Probably a lot. But don't stress it. It is part of the risk/reward satisfaction of the game. If we succeeded, when you beat this game (and every dungeon in between) you will feel a real sense of accomplishment and triumph.

*Good luck and have fun!
